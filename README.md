## General info

In music, **a note** is a symbol denoting a _musical sound_. In English usage, **a note** is also the sound itself.

**Notes** can represent the pitch and duration of a sound in _musical notation_. A note can also represent a pitch class.

**Notes** are the building blocks of much written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and analysis.

The term **note** can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either "the piece 'Happy Birthday to You' begins with two notes having _the same pitch_", or "the piece begins with two repetitions of the same **note**". In the former case, one uses **note** to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing _same pitch_.
